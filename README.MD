 # Proximity alarm 
 
This project was developed using an Arduino microcontroller, ultra sonic sensor, piezzo buzzer and LED lights in order 
to create a proximity alarm. How this alarm works is when the ultra sonic sensor senses an object at 3 different distances
the piezzo buzzer starts to make a sound and the led lights start to flicker. As the object comes nearer and closer
the LED lights change their pattern of flickering and the piezzo buzzer sounds becomes stronger.

This project was developed using an Arduino microcontroller, ultra sonic sensor, piezzo buzzer and LED lights in order 
to create a proximity alarm. How this alarm works is when the ultra sonic sensor senses an object at 3 different distances
the piezzo buzzer starts to make a sound and the led lights start to flicker. As the object comes nearer and closer
the LED lights change their pattern of flickering and the piezzo buzzer sounds becomes stronger. Since somone might
not have the Arduino IDE installed i provide my code in this code file.
